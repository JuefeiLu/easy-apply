# Motivation 
Easy Apply is a job search tool that improves upon the current job seeking process by allowing users 
to create a video introduction of themselves to express creativity and uniqueness of each user. 
Thereby allowing employers to easily digest applicantsâ€™ info via video format without shifting through heaps of resumes.


# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- You will need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the building backend.
- You will need npm and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for building the frontend.
- To deploy a local database, you will need [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Installation and deployment

1. Clone the repo.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/projectf21-team-anything-works.git easy-apply
cd easy-apply
```

2. Go to the backend directory and create a virtual environment. 

```bash
cd backend && python3 -m venv .
```

3. Install python dependencies into the virtual environment using the provided list. 

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
4. Migrate the database

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
```

5. Deploy the flask backend locally

```bash
python3 run.py
```

6. Go to the frontend directory and install all node dependencies

```bash
cd ../frontend && npm i 
```

7. Deploy the React Frontend locally

```bash
npm start
```

## Configuration
Backend configuration is done in [config.py](https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/projectf21-team-anything-works/blob/main/backend/config.py). To connect your database,  
change the following variable appropriately: 
```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "postgresql://{user}:{password}@localhost:{PORT}/{tableName}"
```

The table configured for the dummy API is the following:

```
CREATE TABLE dummyDB ( 
name VARCHAR ( 255 ) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
id  serial PRIMARY KEY, 
date_created TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, date_modified TIMESTAMP );
```

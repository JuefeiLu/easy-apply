**Reflect on how your team worked together**

- Our team worked decently well
- We planned and delegated all tasks a well in advance making sure we divided the work evenly
- We finished all the tasks 1 day prior to the submission, and further refined our work in the last 24 hours. 

**How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**
	
- We organised the team and delegated tasks during our calls on Discord and Zoom
- We created shared documents with all the deliverables for sprint 0, and wrote our names in front of the documents that we will be working on while on the call. We made sure the work was spread evenly and that everyone was working on what they were most comfortable with.

**How did you make decisions?**

- Making decisions as a team was done during the calls. We layed out the agenda as to what all was meant to be accomplished and for each item on the agenda, we would talk about it briefly, expressing our ideas or concerns. Only after everyone who wanted to share something had spoken, we all voted by typing the decisions in the chat. The idea with the  majority vote was agreed upon until everyone was convinced. 

**How did you define the priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?** 

- Before writing the final user stories, we discussed the overarching ideas during the call. Once the user stories were completed, we went on a call, discussed each of the user stories and modified, added or deleted them accordingly to the consensus of the entire team.
- Then, for each user story, we categorized them according to priority (3 being the highest priority and 1 being the lowest priority). Each member assigned a number to these stories (using the poll feature on Zoom). If there was a variation in numbers, people with the minority vote would justify why they thought something had a higher or lower priority. We had an maximum of 3 rounds of planning poker until everyone reached the same number of priority. 

- 3 (High) 
  - will require more work on the backend and front end 
  - that address the unique features of our project
  - are considered more important by Product Owner (Reggie)
  - that we need to get started with immediately (sprint 1 onwards) as they will take longer)

- 2 (Medium)
  - Will require a fair amount of work on the backend and not so much on the front-end
  - That address features that are important to our website, but not necessarily unique

- 1 (Low)
  - Will not require a lot of backend but maybe some work on the frontend
  - Are not considered very important by the Product Owner (our website would still function well and attract viewership without these features)
  - That can be worked on during the later sprints if we feel the necessity to implement them

**How frequently did you meet?**

- The entire team has met 4 times in the past week, to decide on the project, meet with Reggie to discuss the key features and priorities, and decide on implementing the deliverables for sprint 0. 
- For the upcoming sprints, we plan to meet twice a week (Mondays and Fridays at 11 am) as a whole team on Zoom
- Sub teams, depending on who is working on what user story, will meet daily for stand up meetings in the voice channels on Discord

**What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**

- Need to set a clear agenda before each meeting so that everyone knows what we are meant to accomplish by the end of each meeting. This will also help us be more time-efficient. 
- Deciding on meet more than twice a week as a whole group because splitting the discussions and work for 3 meetings instead of having 2 long meetings is helpful.

How is your product different?\ 

Our product allows individuals to create a customized video to represent themselves in a unique way, without resorting to resume, with a customized video pitch, it allows more creativity and personality expression. This allows potential employees to express themselves in a more impactful way, while also giving employers a better view of their personalities. It will also employ an algorithm to judge users and have a rating system for both job seekers and employers, thus creating an effective product.

Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?\

The main users of this product are motivated individuals looking for a way to stand out to employers by showcasing their wonderful persnalities. This includes younger people looking to get into the work force, as they may lack experience in their resume but have a great video introduction. It can also be used by more experienced individuals looking to expand and find more opprtunities. Another user of this product would be any organization looking to fill a role, since they can view resumes alongside video introductions, while also taking advantage of our algorithm.

Our product is for users who are motivated and can create compelling video introductions to employers without needing to apply to jobs using their resume over and over again. Instead they can utilize a video to showcase themselves in a more unique manner and convey more information about themselves through the video, which is a more optimized and efficient approach for the job search process. 

A particular scenario in which you would use this may be that you have a 20 year old student, Nadia, who has just graducated college with a degree in LIfe Sciences and is looking for a job in forensics. However, she has no experience and so her resume is not landing her any jobs. She has a great desire to learn but cannot seem to express that through just a resume.

Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so? \

Most of our competitors focus on the same user base, however, the scenarios are drastically diffrent. We provide a platform that allows individuals to communicate through more than just a resume. Our product utilizes video introduction, which is not a part of the "traditional" hiring process, this is why the larger competitors tend to stay away from it. However, with the increase in technology over the recent years, this allows for a new dimension to creste a more impactful connection with employers. If our product is successful in creating a niche in the job recruitment market, then other competitors would likely take inspiration and create their own version of the video introduction. There is not a huge barrier of entry to add this feture, however, it is still good to be the first in the market.

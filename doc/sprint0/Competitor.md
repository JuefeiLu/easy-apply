It will also employ an algorithm to judge users and have a rating system for both job seekers and employers.


Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios? :


Our product is better for users who are motivated and can create compelling video introductions to employers without needing to apply to jobs using their resume over and over again. Instead they can utilize a video to showcase themselves in a more unique manner and convey more information about themselves through the video, which is a more optimized and efficient approach for the job search process.


Video pitch is particularly effective for jobs requiring video editing and self-presentation such as video editors and social media content creators, since they can showcase their technical skills for the job and introduce themselves to the employer at the same time.  


Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or
scenarios? And, what would it take from them to do so? :


Our product utilizes video introduction, which is not a traditional form of presentation for job search. If our product is successful in creating a niche in the job recruitment market, then other competitors would likely take inspiration and create their own version of the video introduction.
